## Usage

Run your Streamlit app with ngrok tunneling using the following command:

```

### Parameters:
- `<app.py>`: Path to your Streamlit application file.
- `<ngrok_token>`: Your ngrok authentication token.
- `[port]` (Optional): Custom port to run the Streamlit app on. Defaults to `8501` if not specified.

## Examples

### 1. Running with Default Port (8501)
Run your Streamlit app on the default port:

```bash
stc /path/to/your/app.py <your_ngrok_token>
```

### 2. Running with a Custom Port (e.g., 5005)
Specify a custom port, such as `5005`:

```bash
stc /path/to/your/app.py <your_ngrok_token> 5005
```

### 3. Using an Environment Variable for ngrok Token
Set your ngrok token as an environment variable and omit it from the command:

```bash
export NGROK_TOKEN=<your_ngrok_token>
stc /path/to/your/app.py
```

Override the port if needed:

```bash
stc /path/to/your/app.py 5005
```
